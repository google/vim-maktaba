" NOTICE: You probably want @function(#Require) instead. When calling this
" function, YOU ARE EXPECTED TO CATCH ERRORS and format the error messages
" nicely for the user. (See |maktaba#error#Shout|). Otherwise the user
" will see ugly stack traces.
"
" NOTICE: {library} MUST BE A LIBRARY PLUGIN. It should provide only autoloaded
" functions. It should not provide commands, autocmds, key mappings, filetypes,
" or any other user-impacting functionality. maktaba#library#Require is designed
" to allow plugins to pull in other plugins without the user worrying about
" dependencies, but the user should NEVER have weird key mappings / settings
" changes / etc. appearing due to dependencies required by a rogue plugin.
"
" This function will act as follows:
"
" 1. Check whether {library} has already been installed via
"    @function(maktaba#plugin#Install).
" 2. Try each installer registered my
"    @function(maktaba#library#AddInstaller), in order of registration.
"
" The maktaba plugin object will be returned.
"
" In normal usage, the plugin manager will be used to satisfy library
" dependencies at the plugin level (via dependency support if available,
" otherwise manually satisfied by the user). This function is only used to
" safely access the plugin handle from code, and @function(#Require) is used to
" ensure individual files that depend on the library have access to it (or cause
" an error to be printed).
"
" @throws NotALibrary if {library} is not a library plugin.
" @throws NotFound if {library} cannot be installed by any installer.
